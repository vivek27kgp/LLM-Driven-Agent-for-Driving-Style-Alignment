This is my Master Thesis Project 2 at IIT Kharagpur in the department of Artificial Intelligence.
I am working on LLM-based autonomous driving alignment framework.
The instructions for the codes to run. 
download and install Carla 0.9.14. Here is the source link : https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases
After that replace navigation folder in the directory: "C:\Users\vivek\Downloads\Carla_0.9.14\PythonAPI\carla\agents"  with my navigation folder
Also replace automatic_control.py and generate_traffic.py file in the directory: "C:\Users\vivek\Downloads\Carla_0.9.14\PythonAPI\examples" with my automatic_control.py and generate_traffic file

Run the simulator first the we can add traffic or change weathers from the provided codes and then run automatic_control.py to start the automatic driving with llm.
