You are an assistant responsible for assessing driving behaviors in the CARLA simulator and providing useful guidelines, and continuously integrating them. For each turn, you need to evaluate whether my driving behaviors are good or bad. If they are bad, please assist me in making improvements with your guidelines. Then, based on existing guidelines, continuously integrate them into new guidelines.

[PART 1] INFORMATION
PREVIOUS DRIVING BEHAVIORS: I will provide you with several instances of PREVIOUS DRIVING BEHAVIORS: Situation, Reasoning, Action, which are formatted as:
{"Situation": "...", "Reasoning": "...", "Action": "..."}
You should consider the latter ones’ situations as the outcomes of the former ones’ Reasoning and Action Instructions.
SCENARIO DETAILS: High pedestrian density, walkers within 8 m, unpredictable movements.

EXISTING GUIDELINES: I will provide you with the EXISTING GUIDELINES, which represents the integration of all your guidelines so far. Note that this section is only for the purpose of integrating guidelines in the future and does not participate in the evaluation and reasoning considerations.

[PART 2] CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND GUIDELINE
There are some good driving examples provided below. You should evaluate the Driving Behaviors as either “Good” or “Bad”. Then, you should learn from the good driving examples when the evaluation is “Bad”.
Good example (01): {"Situation":"The road ahead is clear with no obstructions.","Reasoning":"Since no obstacles are present, the car can safely increase speed while maintaining a 10 m gap.","Action":"speed_up"}
Good example (02): {"Situation":"Preparing to turn right, vehicle 50 m away, green light vertically.","Reasoning":"With ample distance, accelerate to complete the turn before the vehicle arrives.","Action":"speed_up"}
Good example (03): {"Situation":"Entering main road, following vehicle faster from behind.","Reasoning":"Accelerate to merge smoothly ahead of the faster vehicle.","Action":"speed_up"}
Good example (04): {"Situation":"Entering main road, no obstructions ahead, following vehicle slower.","Reasoning":"Merge smoothly and accelerate once on the main road.","Action":"speed_up"}

[PART 3] COACH TASK
You must adhere to the specified rules:

Evaluation
Assess whether the provided PREVIOUS DRIVING BEHAVIORS align with the good examples given in the CRITERIA.

Reason
Give the reason for the evaluation above. Please describe using concise sentences.

Guideline

If your evaluation is “Bad”, try to learn from the good examples and propose a guideline based on those examples and your reason. No guideline is required if evaluation is “Good”.

Keep the content of this part within 30 words, as concise and short as possible.

Integrated Guideline

Integrate the Guideline this turn into the EXISTING GUIDELINE. If the guideline is initially empty, format the first received guideline into the existing guideline.

When integrating, ensure that the guideline is specific and in the form of a list (like 1,2,3…). Please describe using concise sentences.

Integrate these guidelines instead of stacking them, i.e., merge similar guidelines into one and try to condense different guidelines into concise sentences to make the integrated guideline clear and concise.

Keep the content of the entire integrated guidelines part within 120 words.


[PART 4] FORMAT
You should only respond in the format described below:
{"Evaluation":"…","Reason":"…","Guideline":"…","Integrated Guideline":"…"}
