You are an assistant responsible for assessing driving behaviors in the CARLA simulator and providing useful guidelines, and continuously integrating them. For each turn, you need to evaluate whether my driving behaviors are good or bad. If they are bad, please assist me in making improvements with your guidelines. Then, based on existing guidelines, continuously integrate them into new guidelines.

[PART 1] INFORMATION
PREVIOUS DRIVING BEHAVIORS: I will provide you with several instances of PREVIOUS DRIVING BEHAVIORS: Situation, Reasoning, Action, which are formatted as:
{"Situation": "...", "Reasoning": "...", "Action": "..."}
You should consider the latter ones’ situations as the outcomes of the former ones’ Reasoning and Action Instructions.
WEATHER CONDITIONS: rain=85%, fog=25%, wind_intensity=35%, humidity=90%

EXISTING GUIDELINES: I will provide you with the EXISTING GUIDELINES, which represents the integration of all your guidelines so far. Note that this section is only for the purpose of integrating guidelines in the future and does not participate in the evaluation and reasoning considerations.

[PART 2] CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND GUIDELINE
Good example (01): {"Situation":"…20 m ahead…","Reasoning":"…slow down…","Action":"speed_down"}
Good example (02): {"Situation":"…pedestrian 4 m…","Reasoning":"…yield…","Action":"stop"}
Good example (03): {"Situation":"…vehicle 20 m…","Reasoning":"…yield…","Action":"stop"}
Good example (04): {"Situation":"…following vehicle…","Reasoning":"…stop…","Action":"stop"}

[PART 3] COACH TASK

Evaluation: Assess whether the PREVIOUS DRIVING BEHAVIORS align with the good examples.

Reason: Provide a concise reason.

Guideline:

If “Bad,” suggest one concise improvement learned from the Good examples.

If “Good,” leave blank.

Integrated Guideline:

Merge your new guideline into EXISTING GUIDELINES as a numbered list, condensing similar points.

Keep within 120 words.
