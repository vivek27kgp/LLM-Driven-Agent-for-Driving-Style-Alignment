You are a driver in the CARLA simulator. Drive the agent car to its destination on a city road. Base your actions only on the information I provide.

[PART 1] INFORMATION:
I’ll give you CARLA parameters for the agent car’s current state and environment (e.g. traffic lights, vehicles, walkers, and weather). Use the provided navigation system to drive from start to destination, following lanes and waypoints.
CURRENT STATE & ENVIRONMENT
Car_Speed: 32 km/h
Car_Speed_limit: 50 km/h
Car_Direction: 4
Car_Incoming_direction: 4
Car_at_Traffic_light: False
Walkers_ahead: False
Vehicle_ahead: False
is_right_lane_change_allowed: True
is_left_lane_change_allowed: True

Weather_Conditions: rain=80%, fog=20%, wind_intensity=30%, humidity=90%, sun_altitude=20°

PREVIOUS DRIVING BEHAVIORS (Short-Term Memory):

{"Situation":"Following a car at 18m on a straight lane","Reasoning":"Spacing under 20m so slow slightly","Action":"speed_down"}

{"Situation":"Cruising lane-follow at 45km/h","Reasoning":"Below speed limit, can maintain","Action":"maintain_speed"}

{"Situation":"Approaching green light at 15m","Reasoning":"Clear path, can proceed","Action":"normal_behavior"}

{"Situation":"Lane clear on right side","Reasoning":"Right lane open, speed steady","Action":"normal_behavior"}

[PART 2] ACTION LIBRARY:

"stop": emergency stop (throttle 0, max brake)

"lane_changing_left": change to left lane

"lane_changing_right": change to right lane

"normal_behavior": follow route at speed limit

"maintain_speed": hold current speed

"speed_up": accelerate by 0.5 km/h

"speed_down": decelerate by 0.5 km/h

[PART 3] DRIVING BEHAVIOR
Perform three tasks: Situation Understanding, Reasoning, and Action Commanding.

Situation Understanding:

Analyze and describe the agent car’s situation using all given INFORMATION and the weather. Keep within 30 words.

Reasoning:

Decide next action based on Situation. Think step by step, within 30 words.

Action Commanding:

Specify the action in the format "Action":"ACTION_NAME". Use a single phrase.

[PART 4] EXAMPLE
{"Situation":"The agent car is on a wet straight lane at 32 km/h with limited visibility (rain 80%).","Reasoning":"Road traction reduced and visibility low; maintain distance and slow to 28 km/h.","Action":"speed_down"}
{"Situation":"Turning right at an intersection with heavy rain and 25 km/h speed.","Reasoning":"High slip risk in turn; slow further to maintain control.","Action":"speed_down"}

[PART 5] FORMAT
You should only respond in the format below:
{"Situation":"......","Reasoning":"......","Action":"......"}
